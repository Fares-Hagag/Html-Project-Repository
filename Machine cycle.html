<h1>Machine Cycle Definition</h1>
<p>A Machine cycle, also known as instruction cycle or a processor cycle. In computer architecture,
    <br> it is also sometimes called as (fetch-decode-execute cycle). The Machine cycle consist of a sequence 
    <br> of three steps, which includes fetch, decode and execute. But actually there are four steps in the Machine cycle,
    <br> the fourth one is Store. In the fetch process, the control unit of the microprocessor retrieve
    <br> the instruction from the main memory (RAM), that is stored at the address indicated by the Program counter.
    <br> The Control unit in the CPU decodes the instruction in the Instruction register.  Decoding the instruction in
    <br>the IR involves the splitting the operand field into its components depending upon the Opcode.
    <br> After the Instruction and data is fetched and decoded the instruction is executed by the ALU (arithmetic logical unit) of the CPU.
    <br> The output of the instruction is generated at this stage. This whole process of generating the output
    <br> is known as execution (execution cycle). After the Output is generated the computer stores the results in the memory for later use.
    <br> As soon as the instruction is executed and results are saved, machine cycle is restarted and begins with fetch cycle again..
