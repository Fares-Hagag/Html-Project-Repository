      <h1>Introduction to Computer Architecture
    </h1>
      A general-purpose computer has these parts:</h3> 
<ol>
    <li>processor: the ``brain'' that does arithmetic, responds to incoming information, and generates outgoing information</li>
    <li>primary storage (memory or RAM): the ``scratchpad'' that remembers information that can be used by the processor.
        <br> It is connected to the processor by a system bus (wiring).<br> </li>
    <li>system and expansion busses: the transfer mechanisms (wiring plus connectors) that connect
         the processor to
         <br>primary storage and input/output devices.<br> </li>
</ol> 
<p><br>A computer usually comes with several input/output devices: For input: a keyboard, a mouse; For output  <br>
     a display (monitor), a printer; For both input and output: an internal disk drive, memory key, CD reader/writer, etc.,
     <br> as well as connections to external networks.</p>
     <p><br>For reasons of speed, primary storage is connected ``more closely'' to the processor than are the input/output devices.<br>
         Most of the devices (e.g., internal disk, printer) are themselves primitive computers in the sense that they contain simple<br>
          processors that help transfer information to/from the processor to/from the device.</p>
    <p>Here is a simple picture that summarizes the above:</p>
